I know, the code looks bad, but this was my first big project ever a long time ago. It was stored in a random Drive folder, so I'm uploading to Git now because it's a big part of my history learning how to code.

This was made as the final project of my IT certificate course (or, as we call it in Brazil, technician course). I was always amazed by physics engines in general, so it was a no-brainer that this would be my chosen subject. This was done over a two month period in 2020.

The version of Gustavo that did this code was just having his first JS experience, which later matured a lot. I also didn't know anything about git, so that's why you'll see what you'll see in the `/older_versions` folder (sorry in advance).

Current status:

- Box collision is deactivated (actually, has been deactivated since 2020) because is not working as expected, but some of the older versions have some of the logic built. I think I just didn't finish making the collision with the floor actually working, and that's why is deactivated on the 2.1 demo version.
- The first collision of each ball is buggy, probably because I'm multiplying something by undefined or something like that, but after that it works

If you wanna play with it, i'd say go for it! (and good luck)
